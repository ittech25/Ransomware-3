# Ransomware
A Ransomware with a symmetric encryption algorithm (Fernet) - Made in 15 minutes.

This malware will list all the files in the C: Drive, and return a list with all the files, and then encrypt the files one by one.
I have not tested it on my own PC, but if something does not work, please send me an email - roeil4939@gmail.com

## Requirements

You need a basic knowledge and experience with Python, and a basic knowledge with Encryption and Decryption, and you need to install `requests` and `cryptography` modules, in order to download the images and use the `Fernet` algorithm.

```
$ pip install requests
$ pip install cryptography
```
